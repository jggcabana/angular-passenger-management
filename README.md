# Qless-Web
This project was created with the intent of meeting the requirements of Section D of the *Cambridge Machine Problem*, as well as a demonstration of angular knowledge. This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 16.2.1.

## Pre-requisites
- [node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
- [angular-cli](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@angular/cli) (After installing node, run `npm install -g @angular/cli` in a terminal window.

## Local Machine Setup
1. Navigate to the root folder (there should be an `angular.json` file) and run `npm install` in a terminal. This will install the necessary `node_modules` for the application to start.
2. Run `ng serve --port 4200 -o` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files. Be sure to run the API project that this app will consume.

## Other Technology Considerations
1. CSS Frameworks 
	- [bulma.io](https://bulma.io/), a lightweight alternative to popular CSS frameworks. I chose this as I only needed a bare-bones UI to simulate the application.
	- [Angular Material](https://material.angular.io/), an angular component library for out-of-the-box components like forms and tables.
